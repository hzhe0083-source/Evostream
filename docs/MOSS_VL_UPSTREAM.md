# MOSS-VL

**MOSS-VL** is an open-weight model series for long-form, real-time video understanding, built on a unified **cross-attention** architecture. All three models are 11B-parameter and open-weight.

*   **`MOSS-VL-Realtime`**: real-time interaction over continuous video streams — interruptible at any moment, answering on the fly, and deciding on its own when to respond and when to keep watching.
*   **`MOSS-VL-Instruct`**: built for offline use, with particular strength in complex long-video understanding and in-depth dialogue.
*   **`MOSS-VL-Base`**: an open pre-trained foundation offering strong video–language representations for continued pre-training and downstream fine-tuning.

Unlike the default paradigm of offline video models ("watch first, answer after"), **MOSS-VL-Realtime** is designed for real-time interaction on continuous video streams: it runs multimodal perception and text generation in parallel on a continuously arriving stream, natively supporting multi-turn real-time dialogue and dynamic scene understanding, autonomously deciding when to speak, achieving fine-grained temporal grounding, and streaming its responses.

---

### Key Enhancements

* **Interruptible & Real-time**: Breaking the limits of offline processing, users can ask questions at any timestamp in the video stream. The model instantly responds based on the currently received frames, achieving open-source SOTA latency in streaming interaction.
* **Proactive Silence**: Equipped with dynamic judgment capabilities, the model autonomously stays silent and continues observing when contextual information is insufficient or no key events have occurred.
* **Dynamic Correction**: Cognition updates dynamically with the visual feed. As new frames continue to stream in, the model can instantly capture state changes and correct its previous outputs.

### Core Architecture

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="MOSS-VL Architecture" width="100%"/>
</div>

At the architectural level, **MOSS-VL-Realtime** adopts the following core designs:
- **Cross-Attention Architecture**: Decouples visual encoding from language reasoning, significantly reducing response latency on dynamic video streams, with native support for interleaved image, video, and text inputs.
- **Absolute Timestamps**: Every sampled frame is anchored to a precise time marker via dedicated special tokens. The model uses this to reason about pacing, duration, and motion dynamics, and it natively adapts to variable frame rates.
- **XRoPE (Cross-Attention Rotary Position Embedding)**: Maps text tokens and video patches into a unified 3D `(t, h, w)` coordinate space, enabling patch-level and moment-level grounding across the entire video.

## 📊 Performance

MOSS-VL-Realtime delivers significantly stronger streaming interaction capabilities, achieving open-source SOTA results on multiple streaming video understanding benchmarks. Its "proactive speaking" ability stands out in particular: the model leads on all three proactivity evaluations — Proactive Alerting in OmniMMI, Proactive Output in StreamingBench, and ProactiveVideoQA.

### Streaming Benchmark
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/benchmark-streaming.png" alt="MOSS-VL Streaming Benchmark" width="100%"/>
</div>

We have systematically restructured and deeply optimized our data system, comprehensively strengthening the model's foundational capabilities and instruction-interaction experience, while maintaining a high level of stability across offline evaluations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -n moss_vl python=3.12 pip -y
conda activate moss_vl
pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple --no-build-isolation -r requirements.txt
```

### Real-time Inference

Real-time inference consumes timestamped frames incrementally, so the model can keep perceiving a live video stream while it answers and can accept new questions at any time. The fastest way to replay a local video against its media clock is:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python realtime_inference/run_online_inference.py \
  --checkpoint OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-VL-Realtime \
  --source video \
  --video path/to/example.mp4 \
  --sample-fps 1 \
  --playback-speed 1 \
  --max-frames 256
```

Keep `--playback-speed 1` for model inference so frames arrive on the original timeline. The runtime provides three integration levels:

- `model.create_realtime_session(...)` for direct frame, prompt, and output control
- `model.online_generate(...)` for queue-based inference workers
- `--serve` for a FastAPI WebSocket service that accepts external JPEG/PNG frames or replays server-local videos

It also supports streaming JSONL samples, cameras, screen capture, and synthetic sources. See [`realtime_inference/README.md`](./realtime_inference/README.md) for the complete CLI, input format, and WebSocket protocol.

### Offline Inference

Offline inference supports full-modality queries (interleaved text, image, and video inputs). The fastest way to get a first result is `offline_batch_generate`:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor

checkpoint = "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-VL-Realtime"

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)

queries = [{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "image", "image": "path/to/example.jpg"},
        {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."}
    ]}],
    "generate_kwargs": {"max_new_tokens": 256, "do_sample": False},
}]

with torch.no_grad():
    result = model.offline_batch_generate(processor, queries)

print([item["text"] for item in result["results"]])
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Resources & Ecosystem

### Specialized FlashAttention-3 Backend

The [`flash-attention-src/`](./flash-attention-src/) directory contains the
FlashAttention-3 backend used by MOSS-VL cross-attention. It adds the
`cross_kv_boundary` interface, which represents the visible KV prefix of each
query row with one `int32` value instead of materializing a dense attention
mask. The source is derived from upstream FlashAttention and is bundled here
with its original license and attribution. See
[`flash-attention-src/README.md`](./flash-attention-src/README.md) for the mask
contract, supported paths, build instructions, and source lineage.

### Deployment & Inference Engines
MOSS-VL can also be efficiently deployed with the following inference backends:
- **SGLang**: see [`sglang/README.md`](./sglang/README.md)

### Fine-Tuning
We provide a lightweight SFT framework built on HuggingFace `transformers.Trainer`. It supports full-parameter training and LoRA, with the vision encoder, language model, and LM head independently controllable.

```bash
# Full-parameter SFT (vision encoder frozen by default)
bash finetune/scripts/run_sft.sh

# LoRA SFT
pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple peft
bash finetune/scripts/run_sft_lora.sh
```
See [`finetune/README.md`](finetune/README.md) for full documentation.

### Quantization
We release FP8 and NF4 quantized checkpoints for both Instruct-0708 and Realtime, and share the calibration-free PTQ recipes behind them in [`quant/README.md`](quant/README.md) ([中文教程](quant/README_zh.md)). The guide covers selective layer coverage — which language-model Linears to quantize versus which multimodal modules stay in BF16 — runtime KV-cache quantization for Transformers and SGLang, and reproduction scripts that work directly on your own fine-tuned or SFT checkpoints.
